title: Disable Windows services in Zabbix

{{ page.title }}
================

Services appeared in the supported Windows 10 and Server 2016 systems. Zabbix starts sending messages that the service is not working. If you reboot the computer again, then there will already be two such services.

Go to: Administration â†’ General -> Regular expressions -> Windows service names for discovery.

Change the default value to:
<pre><code>^(MMCSS|gupdate|SysmonLog|clr_optimization.*|OneSync.*|gpsvc|BITS|CDPUserSvc.*|.*KMSELDI|stisvc|UsoSvc|TrustedInstaller
|WbioSrvc|tmlisten|ntrts|ntrtscan|CDPSvc|SCardSvr|tiled.*)$
</code></pre>
